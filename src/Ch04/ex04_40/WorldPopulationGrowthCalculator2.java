// Exercise 4.40: WorldPopulationGrowthCalculator.java
// Write a program that calculates world population growth each year for the next 75 years, 
// using the simplifying assumption that the current growth rate will stay constant. 
// Print the results in a table. The first column should display the year from year 1 to year 75. 
// The second column should display the anticipated world population at the end of that year. 
// The third column should display the numerical increase in the world population that would occur that year. 
// Using your results, determine the year in which the population would be double what it is today, 
// if this yearâ€™s growth rate were to persist.
